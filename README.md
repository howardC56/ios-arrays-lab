# Part 1

## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.
```swift
var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]
print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

```swift
for each in 0..<westernStates.count - 1 {
    if westernStates[each] == "Illinois" {
        westernStates.remove(at: each)
    }
    if westernStates[each] == "Kansas" {
        westernStates.remove(at: each)
    }
}
```
## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

```swift
for each in moreStates {
    if each == "Hawaii" || each == "Alaska" {
        print("\(each): is not in the continental United States")
    } else {
        print("\(each): is in the continental United States")
    }
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

```swift
var count = 0
for char in myString {
    if char != " " {
    count += 1
}
}
print(count)

for quote in myFavoriteQuotes {
var numberNonWhiteSpaces = 0
 for char in quote {
     if char != " " {
         numberNonWhiteSpaces += 1
     }
 }
 print("\(numberNonWhiteSpaces) in quote :\(quote)")

```
## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
```swift
for each in 0..<garden.count - 1 {
    if garden[each] == "ðŸŒ·" {
        basket.append("ðŸŒ·")
        garden[each] = "dirt"
    }
}
print(basket.count)

```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

```swift
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
for each in 0..<battingLineup.count - 1 {
    if battingLineup[each] == "Jeter" {
        battingLineup[each] = "Tejada"
    }
    if battingLineup[each] == "Thomas" {
        battingLineup[each] = "Guerrero"
    }
    if battingLineup[each] == "Reyes" {
        battingLineup[each] = battingLineup[7]
        battingLineup[7] = "Reyes"
    }
}
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```
Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```
```swift
var contains = numbers.filter{$0 == target}
```

## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```swift
let sorted = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
print(sorted.last!)
```

## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```swift
let sorted = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
print(sorted.first!)
```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`

```swift
for i in secondListOfNumbers {
if i % 2 == 1 {
print(i)
}
}
```

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```swift
print(thirdListOfNumbers.reduce(0, +))
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```swift
var sum = 0
for each in 0..<thirdListOfNumbers.count - 1 {
    if thirdListOfNumbers[each] % 2 == 0 {
        sum += thirdListOfNumbers[each]
}
}
print(sum)
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```
```swift
var numberOfSharedInts = 0
for each in listOne {
    if listTwo.contains(each) {
        sharedElements.append(each)
        numberOfSharedInts += 1
    }
}
print(numberOfSharedInts)

```

# Part 2

## Question 1

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```
```swift
var noDupeList = Set(dupeFriendlyList)
```
## Question 2

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

```swift
let sorted = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
let secondSmallest = sorted[1]
```
## Question 3

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```swift
var sum = 0
for each in 3..<1000 {
    if each % 3 == 0 || each % 5 == 0 {
        sum += each
    }
}
print(sum)
```
## Question 4

Make an array that contains all elements that appear **more than twice** in `someRepeatsAgain`.

```swift
var someRepeatsAgain = [25,11,30,31,50,28,4,37,13,20,24,38,28,14,44,33,7,43,39,35,36,42,1,40,7,14,23,46,21,39,11,42,12,38,41,48,20,23,29,24,50,41,38,23,11,30,50,13,13,16,10,8,3,43,10,20,28,39,24,36,21,13,40,25,37,39,31,4,46,20,38,2,7,11,11,41,45,9,49,31,38,23,41,16,49,29,14,6,6,11,5,39,13,17,43,1,1,15,25]
```
```swift
let mapped = someRepeatsAgain.map {($0, 1)}
let counts = Dictionary(mapped, uniquingKeysWith: +)
let filtered = counts.filter{$0.value > 2}
let result = filtered.keys
print(result)
```

## Question 5

Identify if there are 3 integers that sum to 10 in the following array. If so, print them as a triplet. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

`var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]`

```swift
for num1 in tripleSumArr {
    for num2 in tripleSumArr {
        for num3 in tripleSumArr {
            if num1 + num2 + num3 == 10 {
                print("\(num1), \(num2), \(num3)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Question 6

    for char in word {
        if char == "a" {
            counterOne += 1
        }
    }
    if counterOne > counterTwo {
        most = word
    }
    counterTwo = counterOne
    counterOne = 0

print(most)

```

## Question 7

Given an Array of Arrays of Ints, find the Array of Ints with the largest sum:
